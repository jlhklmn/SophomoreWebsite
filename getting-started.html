                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <h3>You'll have to get to know the simpliest controls of Roblox Studio in order to make experiences efficiently and professionally. Here we will talk about the very basics that you will know for most of your development journey.</h3>
                <img src="toolbar.png" title="The toolbar in studio while editing an experience" style="width: 86%; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px black;">
                <h3>This is the toolbar. It is located above your screen when you're editing an experience, and it has everything you'll need. Here you can find lots of important buttons, such as the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/model-tab#transform-tools">Transformation tools</a>, <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/properties">Properties</a> and <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/explorer">Explorer</a> tab, etc.</h3>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 52px; margin-bottom: 26px;">Explorer & Properties Tab</h2>
                <h3>Under the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/view-tab">View tab</a>, you can find the two tabs which you will be using a lot: the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/explorer">Explorer</a> and <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/properties">Properties</a> tab. These tabs allow you to control most things. The Explorer is like a list, which shows you all the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/parts">Parts</a>, <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/Script">Scripts</a> or <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript">Local Scripts</a>, and other objects. You can select them and click 'F' to go to them if they are a part, and if they're a script you can double click to open them. While having them selected, you can see their properties under the Properties tab. All object contains different properties, some properties may be in multiple types of objects while some may not be.</h3>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 52px; margin-bottom: 14px;">Transformation Tools</h2>

                <h3>The <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/model-tab#transform-tools">Transformation Tools</a> are what allows us to build with our imagination. There are three types of main tools; Move, Scale and Rotate. Parts, Models and other similar objects can be modified using these tools.</h3>
              
                <h2 style="margin-top: 52px; margin-bottom: 14px;">Workspace Environment</h2>
                <h3>This is your workspace. You can go around this virtual environment by moving the camera around. Left click allows you to select objects, and dragging right click can change your looking direction. Use 'A, S, W, D' to move horizontally, and 'Q, E' for vertical movement. Using this space, you can create your game by changing parts around using the transformation tools.</h3>

                <h1>Parts, Meshes, Decals & Textures</h1>

                <h2>Parts</h2>
                <h3>Parts are one of the core building blocks all Roblox games. They are what makes the game visually appealing and having good visuals can attract players into playing your games.</h3>

                <img src="fish.png" title="Fish model in blender" style="width: 86%; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px black; max-width: 540px; margin-top: 24px;">
                <h2 style="margin-top: 52px; margin-bottom: 14px;">Meshes</h2>
                <h3><a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MeshPart">Meshes</a> are useful when building your experience. They are parts with 3D-models attached into them. A free popular option for creating 3D-models is <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, and it's used among many developers and even film makers. 3D-models allows more detailed and complex parts to be created, which may be a struggle to do so by only using parts provided by Roblox Studio alone.</h3>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 52px; margin-bottom: 14px;">Decals & Textures</h2>
                <h3>The <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/Color3">Color</a> and <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/Material">Material</a> property is helpful when theming your game. To customize even further, you can use <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Decal">Decals</a> or <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Texture">Textures</a>. Decals are basically images displayed on specified sides on a part. Textures are a type of decal, except the image repeats forever, creating an iterating pattern.</h3>

                <h1 style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Services</h1>
                <h3>Services can be useful in many instances. They are usually used in scripts, but some are also used outside of scripts. Some examples are ReplicatedStorage or ServerStorage, which are used for storing objects, Lighting, which manages the atmosphere of the game, StarterPlayer, which allows you to change the default player's behavior, etc.</h3>

                <img src="services.png" title="Game services" style="width: 86%; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px black; max-width: 270px; margin-top: 24px;">
                
                <h3>ReplicatedStorage and ServerStorage both stores objects. In online-game development, there are two sides; Client and Server. The server usually handles the data and client handles the visuals, also meaning the client is your computer, and exploiters can modify their client to cheat in games. ReplicatedStorage can be accessed by the client while ServerStorage cannot, so usually things you don't want exploiters to easily mess with you would store in ServerStorage. Although do keep in mind, there isn't really a way for the client to access things inside ServerStorage so usually model assets are stored in ReplicatedStorage.</h3>
                <h3>If you are still new to scripting there will be some struggles understanding this. If you want to learn about scripting, you can find the <a id="href" href="script.html">guide</a> for scripting back at the homepage.</h3>

                <h3><a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/ui">User Interfaces</a> are a great way of making your game interactive. There are many types of interfaces, the three graphical user interfaces (also known as 'GUI'), are the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui">ScreenGui</a>, <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SurfaceGui">SurfaceGui</a>, and <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/BillboardGui">BillboardGui</a>.</h3>
                <h3>ScreenGuis usually is used the most, it allows interfaces to be placed on the user's screen. Interfaces are things such as buttons or textboxes, or even images. SurfaceGuis, just like it's name, is user interfaces attached onto a part's specified surface. Lastly, BillboardGuis are user interfaces that can be placed into parts or attachments, and it will float within it's parent. Usually if it's inside a part, the part will be made anchored, transparent and CanCollide off, to make it look like it's just some floating interface.</h3>
                
                <img src="user-interface.png" title="An example of a ScreenGui user interface in studio" style="width: 86%; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px black; max-width: 540px; margin-top: 24px;">
                <h3>This is an example of a user interface on a <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ScreenGui">ScreenGui</a>.

                <h3>As you can see, not all components are visible, as they can't all fit on the screen at once. We can still see the main components that makes up this interface, so this will do for now, as it would be harder to understand if I added more screenshots.</h3>
                
                <h3>Here's a brief description of each component seen on the image and what they each do:</h3>
                <h3>

                <h3>Like webpage development, game development is also managed with front-end and back-end code. The server (back-end) usually manages all the data, while the client (front-end) shows the visuals and manages the user interactions.</h3>
                <h3>This was also mentioned in the <a id="href" onclick="anchor(5)">Services</a> topic. <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/LocalScript">LocalScript</a>, like how it's name suggests, manages things locally, in other words manages client. <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Script">Script</a> on the other hand manages server-side things. There is a third type of script called <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript">ModuleScript</a>, although it is more advanced so this topic will not be covered a lot in this webpage.</h3>
                <h3>Local scripts only works if it's placed under certain locations, such as the player, player's character or backpack, or the <a id="href" target="_blank" href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerGui">PlayerGui</a>.</h3>
